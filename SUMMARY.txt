================================================================================
PHASE 2: DATA PREPROCESSING
File: notebooks/preprocessing.ipynb
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE:
---------
Prepare clean, scaled data for model training with proper train-test split
and feature normalization. Create two dataset versions for flexibility.

VERSION 1: TRAIN-TEST SPLIT (v1_train_test)
--------------------------------------------

Steps Performed:
1. Feature-Target Separation
   Input: Raw California Housing DataFrame
   X shape: (20640, 8) - All features except MedHouseVal
   y shape: (20640,) - Target variable only

2. Train-Test Split (80-20 ratio)
   Random State: 42 (for reproducibility)
   X_train shape: (16512, 8)
   X_test shape: (4128, 8)
   y_train shape: (16512,)
   y_test shape: (4128,)

3. StandardScaler Normalization
   Fit scaler on training data only (prevent data leakage)
   X_train_scaled shape: (16512, 8)
   X_test_scaled shape: (4128, 8)
   
   Scaling Results (Sample - First 5 features):
   Train Mean: [~0.000, ~0.000, ~0.000, ~0.000, ~0.000] (near zero after scaling)
   Train Std:  [~1.000, ~1.000, ~1.000, ~1.000, ~1.000] (unit variance)
   Test Mean:  [~-0.01, ~-0.02, ~-0.01, ~0.02, ~0.01] (close to train mean)
   Test Std:   [~0.99, ~0.99, ~0.99, ~0.99, ~0.99] (consistent with train)

4. Files Saved
   ✓ X_train_scaled.npy - (16512, 8) array
   ✓ X_test_scaled.npy - (4128, 8) array
   ✓ y_train.npy - (16512,) array
   ✓ y_test.npy - (4128,) array
   Location: data/v1_train_test/

VERSION 2: TRAIN-VALIDATION-TEST SPLIT (v2_train_val_test)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Steps Performed:
1. Primary Train-Test Split (80-20)
   Same as v1

2. Secondary Validation Split from Training Set
   Split X_train into:
   - X_train2: (13209, 8) - 80% of original training
   - X_val: (3303, 8) - 20% for validation

3. Independent Scaling (No Data Leakage)
   Scaler fitted ONLY on X_train2
   Three datasets transformed independently:
   - X_train2_scaled: (13209, 8)
   - X_val_scaled: (3303, 8)
   - X_test_scaled_v2: (4128, 8)

4. Additional Artifacts Saved
   ✓ X_train_scaled.npy, X_val_scaled.npy, X_test_scaled.npy
   ✓ y_train.npy, y_val.npy, y_test.npy
   ✓ feature_names.json - Column names for reference
   ✓ scaler.joblib - Fitted scaler for inference
   Location: data/v2_train_val_test/

PREPROCESSING DECISIONS:
-----------------------
✓ Test Size: 20% (4128 samples) - Good balance for evaluation
✓ StandardScaler: Normalizes features to mean=0, std=1
  - REQUIRED for regularized models (Ridge, Lasso)
  - Without scaling, regularization penalizes large-range features unfairly
  - Tree-based models are scale-invariant (splits on values, not magnitudes)
  - Applied for pipeline consistency despite tree models not needing it
✓ Random State 42: Ensures reproducibility across runs
✓ Two versions: v1 (train/test) for evaluation, v2 (train/val/test) for tuning


================================================================================
PHASE 3: BASELINE LINEAR & REGULARIZED MODELS
File: notebooks/baseline_models.ipynb
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE:
---------
Establish baseline performance with interpretable linear models and test
the effectiveness of regularization techniques.

MODELS TRAINED & EVALUATED:
---------------------------

1. LINEAR REGRESSION (OLS - Ordinary Least Squares)
   Description: Baseline unregularized linear model
   Hyperparameters: Default (no regularization)
   
   Performance Metrics:
   - RMSE: ~0.74
   - MAE: ~0.53
   - R² Score: ~0.57
   
   Interpretation: Model explains ~57% of variance in housing prices.
   High error suggests linear relationships insufficient.

2. RIDGE REGRESSION (L2 Regularization)
   Description: Adds L2 penalty (alpha) to cost function to prevent overfitting
   
   Alpha = 1.0 (single run):
   - RMSE: ~0.73
   - MAE: ~0.53
   - R² Score: ~0.58
   
   Alpha Tuning Results (Multiple alphas tested):
   
   Alpha = 0.01:
   - RMSE: ~0.74, MAE: ~0.53, R² ≈ 0.57
   
   Alpha = 0.1:
   - RMSE: ~0.74, MAE: ~0.53, R² ≈ 0.57
   
   Alpha = 1.0:
   - RMSE: ~0.73, MAE: ~0.53, R² ≈ 0.58
   
   Alpha = 10.0:
   - RMSE: ~0.72, MAE: ~0.53, R² ≈ 0.59 [BEST]
   
   Alpha = 100.0:
   - RMSE: ~0.70, MAE: ~0.54, R² ≈ 0.61 [BEST ALPHA]
   
   Interpretation: Stronger regularization (higher alpha) slightly improves
   performance, but gains plateau. Linear model fundamentally limited.

3. LASSO REGRESSION (L1 Regularization - Feature Selection)
   Description: Adds L1 penalty that can shrink coefficients to zero
   
   Alpha = 0.01 (single run):
   - RMSE: ~0.73
   - MAE: ~0.53
   - R² Score: ~0.58
   - Non-zero Coefficients: 8/8 (all features retained)
   
   Alpha Tuning Results (Multiple alphas tested):
   
   Alpha = 0.001:
   - RMSE: ~0.74, MAE: ~0.53, R² ≈ 0.57
   - Non-zero Features: 8/8
   
   Alpha = 0.01:
   - RMSE: ~0.73, MAE: ~0.53, R² ≈ 0.58
   - Non-zero Features: 8/8
   
   Alpha = 0.1:
   - RMSE: ~0.74, MAE: ~0.54, R² ≈ 0.57
   - Non-zero Features: 6-7/8 [Some features eliminated]
   
   Alpha = 1.0:
   - RMSE: ~1.20, MAE: ~0.79, R² ≈ 0.18
   - Non-zero Features: 2-3/8 [Many features zeroed out]
   
   Interpretation: Lasso performs feature selection but offers marginal
   improvement. Strong L1 penalty causes underfitting.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
**Bias-Variance Analysis:**
Linear/regularized models suffer from HIGH BIAS due to additive assumptions.
Real housing prices involve non-linear income effects and income×location interactions.
Regularization (L1/L2) prevents overfitting but cannot overcome model structure limitations.
Ridge with α=100 achieves R² ≈ 0.61 (39% unexplained = non-linear effects).

**Evaluation:** Single 80-20 train-test split (4,128 test samples) - sufficient for stable metrics
✓ Tree-based/ensemble methods needed for better performance

FINAL MODEL SELECTION RATIONALE - LIGHTGBM:
--**ACCURACY**: Highest R² (0.86) explains 86% of housing price variance
✓ **ROBUSTNESS**: Lowest RMSE (0.43) and MAE (0.28) with minimal train-test gap
✓ **EFFICIENCY**: Leaf-wise tree growth captures optimal decision boundaries
✓ **SCALABILITY**: Handles 20K+ samples efficiently with parallel processing
✓ **REGULARIZATION**: Implicit regularization via num_leaves=31 (complexity control)
✓ **HYPERPARAMETER QUALITY**: Manual grid search guided by validation intuition
✓ **GENERALIZATION**: Subsample=0.8, colsample_bytree=0.8 prevent overfitting
✓ **REPRODUCIBILITY**: Fixed random_state=42 for consistent results

**Why Boosting Outperforms Linear Models:**
- Captures non-linear income-price relationship automatically
- Learns income × geography interactions without explicit feature engineering
- Sequential error correction focuses on hard-to-predict residuals
- Tree depth/leaf count naturally regularizes complexity
✓ REPRODUCIBILITY: Random state fixed for consistent results

## MODEL INTERPRETABILITY & EXPLAINABILITY

To understand WHY the LightGBM model makes its predictions, we employ two approaches:

### 1. Feature Importance (Gain)
- **What it measures:** Contribution to loss reduction across all tree splits
- **Interpretation:** Higher gain = feature splits more frequently & effectively
- **Key Finding:** MedInc (median income) has highest gain, followed by Latitude/Longitude
- **Limitation:** Doesn't explain individual predictions, only global importance

### 2. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) Analysis
- **What it measures:** Each feature's contribution to prediction relative to baseline
- **Approach:** TreeExplainer with interventional feature perturbation
- **Visualizations:**
  - **Summary Plot (Violin):** Feature impact distribution across all samples
  - **Summary Plot (Bar):** Average absolute impact magnitude per feature
  - **Dependence Plots:** Relationship between feature values and model impact
  - **Force Plots:** Individual prediction breakdown (baseline + feature contributions)

**Computational Efficiency:**
- Background set: 1,000 random training samples (reference for SHAP)
- Explain set: 2,000 random test samples (manageable computation)
- Method: TreeExplainer with "interventional" perturbation (faster than model-agnostic methods)

**Key Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
✓ MedInc: Strongest positive predictor (higher income → higher price)
✓ Latitude: Strong geographic effect (coastal location premium visible)
✓ Longitude: Complements latitude for location-based pricing
✓ AveOccup: Moderate effect on predictions
✓ Features interact non-linearly (cannot be explained by simple coefficients)

PHASE 5: MODEL OPTIMIZATION & INTERPRETATION
File: notebooks/model_optimization_and_interpretation.ipynb.ipynb
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE:
---------
Transform best-performing non-linear baseline models into production-grade systems
through feature engineering, optimal hyperparameter tuning, and comprehensive
model interpretability analysis using SHAP and local explanation techniques.

        * Dominant signals: MedInc and Geographic location
        * Coherent feature contributions
        * Model correctly identifies standard housing pattern
        
      - Case 2: High-Error Prediction (Atypical Pattern)
        * Conflicting feature signals
        * Rare feature combination not well-represented in training
        * Model underestimates for houses with low income but positive location premium
        * Demonstrates model limitations on out-of-distribution samples
        
   C. Error Analysis Insights
      - SHAP helps identify why model fails on specific cases
      - Reveals underrepresented feature combinations
      - Guides data collection or model improvement strategies

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

**Key Finding:** Feature engineering + hyperparameter tuning provides marginal
improvement (R² 0.86 → 0.87). The primary performance driver is still the
underlying model architecture (boosting), not feature engineering.

**Implications:**
- Boosting algorithms are robust; modest gains from careful feature engineering
- Spatial clustering captures geographic effects, but raw coordinates still dominate
- Advanced models have already extracted most learnable signal from raw features
- Further improvement likely requires:
  a) Additional external data (e.g., crime rates, school quality)
  b) Ensemble of diverse model types
  c) Target variable transformation or stratified modeling

PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY:
==============================

**Selected Model:** LightGBM Regressor (Final)
**Reasoning:**
✓ Highest R² score (0.86-0.87)
✓ Lowest inference latency (leaf-wise growth is efficient)
✓ Best generalization (lowest train-test gap)
✓ Interpretable via SHAP analysis
✓ Robust to feature distribution shifts
✓ Industry-standard (deployed in production at many companies)

**Artifacts for Production:**
✓ Fitted LightGBM model (joblib format)
✓ Data scaler for feature normalization
✓ Feature engineering functions (spatial clustering, derived features)
✓ SHAP explainer for local interpretability
✓ Expected input ranges and preprocessing steps

**Next Steps:**
1. ✓ Model selection complete
2. → Save model + preprocessing pipeline
3. → Deploy via REST API (FastAPI/Flask)
4. → Implement model monitoring (prediction drift, feature drift)
5. → Set up A/B testing framework for incremental improvements
6. → Schedule periodic retraining (quarterly or when performance degrades)

INTERPRETABILITY SUMMARY:
=======================

The SHAP analysis provides actionable insights:

**Global Insights (Why does the model work?):**
- Housing prices are primarily driven by **Median Income** (strongest predictor)
- **Geographic location** (Latitude/Longitude) provides secondary but important signal
- **Household characteristics** (rooms, bedrooms, occupancy) have moderate effects
- This aligns with domain knowledge: California coastal premium is real, income matters

**Local Insights (Why did it predict this value?):**
- Waterfall plots show feature-by-feature contribution to specific predictions
- For accurate predictions: Features align coherently (low SHAP variance)
- For inaccurate predictions: Conflicting signals suggest outlandish feature combinations
- Helps identify outliers and data quality issues

**Limitation Identification:**
- SHAP analysis revealed that model underperforms on rare feature combinations
- Suggests training data is not uniformly representative of feature space
- Can guide future data collection strategies

================================================================================
MODEL DEPLOYMENT READINESS
================================================================================

SELECTED MODEL: LightGBM Regressor
PERFORMANCE: R² = 0.86, RMSE = 0.43, MAE = 0.28

NEXT STEPS FOR PRODUCTION:
1. Save fitted LightGBM model (pickle/joblib format)
2. Save scaler for feature normalization
3. Create inference API (FastAPI/Flask)
4. Implement model monitoring and retraining pipeline
5. Set up A/B testing framework
6. Document expected input ranges and preprocessing

LIMITATIONS & CONSIDERATIONS:
✓ Model trained on California housing data (2013)
✓ May not generalize to other regions/time periods
✓ Performance degrades if feature distributions shift
✓ Requires scaled features (UPDATED)
